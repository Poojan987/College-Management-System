Course Description: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (CSE 101)

Course Credit :1.5
Faculty : KuntalKumar Patel and Aditya Patel

The course is aimed to provide exposure to object oriented programming paradigm and understand 
fundamental concepts of object oriented programming (OOP). 
The course will enable students to design and develop object oriented programs in high level programming 
languages like Java.
Following topics will be covered in the course:
Fundamental concepts of object oriented programming, object oriented problem solving and 
programming paradigm, designing object oriented programs using classes and objects:
     primitive v/s object data types, Arrays, Understanding Java Platform, Environment and API Library; 
     Static and Runtime Polymorphism; Inheritance; Exception Handling; Abstract Class, Packages,
     File Handling; Event-driven Programming; Graphical User Interface development

Course Objectives
- To understand the object oriented paradigm and its advantages.
- To understand fundamental concepts of object oriented programming like abstraction, 
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, aggregation among others.
- Design and develop programs for engineering and real world problems.
- Exposure with professional programming and best practices like reusable and modularized coding,
 coding standards, conventions and source code documentation.
